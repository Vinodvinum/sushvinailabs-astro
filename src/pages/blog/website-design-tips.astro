      <p>
        Design a fast, clear, and conversion-focused website that helps local
        customers contact you and book services easily.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Mobile-First Design</h2>
      <p>
        Most local searches happen on phones. Design for mobile first, then
        scale up for tablets and desktops.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Speed & Performance</h2>
      <p>
        Optimize images, enable lazy loading, and minimize third-party scripts
        to consistently achieve 90+ Google PageSpeed scores.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Clear Calls-to-Action</h2>
      <p>
        Make primary actions—Call, WhatsApp, Book—highly visible and accessible
        above the fold.
      </p>

      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Pro Tip:</strong>
        Use a WhatsApp floating button and a short booking form to reduce
        friction and increase conversions.
      </div>

      <h2>4. Local SEO Basics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use structured schema markup for local businesses</li>
        <li>Create dedicated service pages for primary search terms</li>
        <li>Maintain consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone) across the web</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Accessibility & Trust</h2>
      <p>
        Readable fonts, good contrast, fast loading, and trust signals such as
        reviews and certifications significantly improve conversions.
      </p>
